# Evaluation knowledge base: NextChat

Additive, grounded documentation of this codebase, under `.eval/`. Outside it, the change that adds this
writes `@uxid` comment identifiers (see `identifiers.md`) and, when it installs it, the Eva SDK, as its
description says, plus any file listed under "Outside .eval/".
